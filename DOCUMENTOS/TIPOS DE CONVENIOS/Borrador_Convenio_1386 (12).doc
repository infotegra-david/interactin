 <p><b>AGREEMENT FOR STUDENT EXCHANGES BETWEEN UNIVERSIDAD DE LA SALLE, BOGOTÁ D.C., COLOMBIA AND INGENIERÍA INFORMÁTICA INTEGRAL LTDA - INFOTEGRA - BOGOTÁ,COLOMBIA</b></p>
 </div>
 <p><b>Declaration of Purpose</b></p>
 <p>Whereas the Universidad de La Salle (hereinafter known as UdLS) and the INGENIERÍA INFORMÁTICA INTEGRAL LTDA - INFOTEGRA (hereinafter known as “Partner”) desire to expand scholarly ties, facilitate academic cooperation, and promote mutual understanding, UdLS and the partner have agreed to establish a mutually beneficial student exchange relationship. Now therefore, UdLS and the partner agree as follows:</p>
 <p><b>SECTION 1 Rules governing the student exchange</b></p>
 <p><b>1.0 Basic terms.</b> UdLS and partner agree to an exchange of [undergraduate, graduate or both] students for a period of three academic years beginning in [STARTING DATES FOR THE AGREEMENT] with nominations being exchanged by a mutually agreed upon date. This exchange shall be governed by the following rules:</p>
 <p><b>1.1 Access.</b> Students will be permitted to enroll in all courses and programs at the Host University for which they are qualified with the exception of those courses or programs in which places may not be available due to enrollment limitations. Students will be entitled to the same privileges and subject to the same rules and regulations as other students at the host institution. UdLS students will be admitted as University Students and will attend regular classes and the orientation program, which partners offers for exchange students.</p>
 <p><b>1.2 Quotas.</b> For each year, each partner may send to the host institution the equivalent of two full-time students per academic year. The overall number participating in the exchange can be increased with the consent of both partners.</p>
 <p><b>1.3 Balance.</b> If a balance of students exchanged between UdLS and partner is not achieved in a given year, the exchange will be brought back into balance in each three-year cycle. No imbalance should be carried beyond a period of three years.</p>
 <p><b>1.4 Student status.</b> All students shall be bona fide students of the home institution and be engaged in a degree-oriented course of study. The home institution will recognize the credits its students earn while at the host institution. It is understood that students admitted under the terms of this Agreement will continue as candidates for degrees at their home institution, and will not be candidates for degrees of the host institution.</p>
 <p><b>1.5 Selection of participants.</b> Each university will determine its own method of selecting students for the exchange program. The official acceptance of students recommended for the exchange program is contingent upon final acceptance by the host institution. Final decisions will be made on the basis of the candidates' qualifications (e.g. academic record, language proficiency, ability to benefit from a particular course of study at the host institution) and the availability of space.</p>
 <p><b>1.6 Language ability.</b> Students must possess language ability necessary to fulfill their academic work plan. UdLS and partner will nominate students with an intermediate score on official languages proficiency certificate if apply.</p>
 <p><b>1.7 Tuition and fees.</b> Each student will pay any tuition at the home institution and shall not be assessed additional tuition by the host institution. Additional fees and course fees may be assessed by the host institution for which the student will be financially responsible.</p>
 <p><b>1.8 Housing, food, travel.</b> All UdLS and partner students will be financially responsible for their own housing, food, and travel. The host institution will assist participants in obtaining housing to the extent feasible. When possible, residence hall housing will be arranged.</p>
 <p><b>SECTION 2 Administration of the exchange</b></p>
 <p><b>2.0 Exchange officers.</b> An exchange officer for each institution shall administer this exchange. The Chief Academic Officer, or her/his designee, shall serve as exchange officer for UdLS. The Head of International Affairs, or her/his designee, shall serve as exchange officer for Partner.</p>
 <p><b>2.1 Review and termination of the project.</b> The partners will regularly review the exchange created under this agreement to assess the desirability and feasibility of continuing the relationship under present terms. The partners may terminate the relationship at a mutually agreed upon date. Either partner may terminate the relationship by written notice to the exchange officer of the partner institution one year prior to the date of termination if balance has been achieved or if an alternative, mutually agreed upon settlement has been reached.</p>
 <p><b>2.2 Limitation of resources committed.</b> This agreement does not create an obligation for either party to provide resources necessary to carry out the project except as approved by the party responsible for providing those resources. No supplementary funding commitments are created for either party by this agreement.</p>
 <p><b>2.3 Refund of fees.</b> No refund of tuition or fees will be made if a student is unable to complete her/his course. Once a student has arrived at the host institution, the student will be included in the calculation of balance even if the student withdraws before the end of the semester underway.</p>
 <p><b>2.4 Approval and duration.</b> This agreement shall take effect upon signature below by each of the partners for the term beginning in [STARTING DATES OF THE AGREEMENT] and shall be in force until either partner provides notice of termination as outlined in the Memorandum of Understanding executed by and between the parties.</p> 
 <p>Wherefore the parties have set their hands on the dates indicated below.</p>
